#summary Using the SL018 RFID

= Introduction =

When a MiFare card is presented, our program will read in the card ID. A default profile and setting file is pre-programmed into the arduino. The system will adjust the threshold and sound the buzzer if the threshold is breached.

Our Device uses the SL018 RFID module. In order to use it, we referenced [http://rfid.marcboon.com/ Marc Boon's RFID Sniffer code]. We used his code from https://github.com/marcboon/RFIDuino and modified it so that we can read a MiFare card for it's ID number.
